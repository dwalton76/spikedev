spikedev
========
spikedev is an open source micropython library for
`LEGO SPIKE <https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime-set/45678#product>`_.
The goal of this library is to build on the functionality provided by LEGO's ``import hub`` library.
spikedev is not firmware, it is simply a colletion of ``.py`` files that you copy to your SPIKE hub
and then import like any other library.

Many features in spikedev were ported from `ev3dev-lang-python <https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang-python>`_.
