# spikedev
spikedev is an open source micropython library for [LEGO SPIKE](https://education.lego.com/en-us/products/lego-education-spike-prime-set/45678#product). The goal of this library is to build on the functionality provided by LEGO’s ``import hub`` library. spikedev is not firmware, it is simply a colletion of .py files that you copy to your SPIKE hub and then import like any other library.

For docs please see the [spikedev documentation](https://dwalton76.github.io/spikedev/)
